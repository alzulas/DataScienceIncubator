There are some fun graphs in here.

The PNGs
-Number of fires by year
-Number of fire by state

The screen shots include 
-A map of the US showing the number of Fires
-A map of the US showing the size of the fires in the different locations

Hoping to expand this research and see if I can predict how likely it is for a fire to occur in a location.
Probably K-NN, maybe Baysian
