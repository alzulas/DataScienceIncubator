There are some fun graphs in here.

The PNGs

-Number of fires by year   https://github.com/alzulas/DataScienceIncubator/blob/master/NumberOfFiresByYear.png

-Number of fire by state   https://github.com/alzulas/DataScienceIncubator/blob/master/NumberOfFiresByState.png

The screen shots include 

-A map of the US showing the number of Fires https://github.com/alzulas/DataScienceIncubator/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-02-19%20at%2010.28.07%20PM.png

-A map of the US showing the size of the fires in the different locations

Hoping to expand this research and see if I can predict how likely it is for a fire to occur in a location.
Probably K-NN, maybe Baysian
